# golangBowlingAPI
This code is a bowling API created using golang and gRPC
## 
To run the code you have to have grpc installed and protobuf. Here is a link to the grpc Golang page if curious about any grpc/golang details: https://grpc.io/docs/tutorials/basic/go/

Once installed run the commands
go run bowlingServer/main.go and go run bowlingClient/main.go
from the directory the repo was installed under and a game of bowling will commence!

Make sure $GOPATH is set and grpc is installed under the go/bin folder or the code will not work.
Used Go version 1.10.4 to write this code.
